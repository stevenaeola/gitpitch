</ul>
</section>
<section id="learning-log" class="slide level2">
<h2>Learning log</h2>
<p>Make at least four separate entries, with at least two weeks between each entry. The entries can either be separate files or different sections within the same file. They should be written using Markdown and stored in a private repository on GitHub. You need to commit and push each entry as you make it so that the dates of the entries are correctly recorded in git. You can include images and external links.</p>
<p>For each entry identify - What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project) - What you have learned - Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the first entry) - Next step(s) to achieve your goals</p>
<p>The learning log should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, as measured by the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wordcount">Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin</a> and have a reasonable balance between the entries.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-criteria-10-each">Assessment criteria (10% each)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number, timing and word count of entries (use of git)</li>
<li>Appropriate development and monitoring of goals</li>
<li>Evidence of increased understanding</li>
<li>Evidence of collaboration</li>
<li>Evidence of criticality about your own actions and assumptions</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="guide-for-learners" class="slide level2">
<h2>Guide for learners</h2>
<p>Based on your experience, write a Markdown document which explains to somebody else how to master the skill you have been learning. The report should be structured as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation (10%): Why learn it</li>
<li>Background (10%): What do you need to know before starting, including links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is</li>
<li>Learning materials (10%): appropriate links to external resources with commentary</li>
<li>Evaluation (10%): How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of learning it</li>
</ul>
<p>A presentation mark (10%) will be awarded on the basis of - formatting in （<a href="https://GitHub.GitHub.com/gfm/">GitHub flavored</a>) Markdown - choice of media (images, video) - clear writing style appropriate for audience</p>
<p>The guide for learners should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, as measured by the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wordcount">Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin</a></p>
</section>
<section id="submission" class="slide level2">
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Your learning log and your guide for learners should be held within a single private repository on GitHub. In the repository you should include a README file including a link to the repository on GitHub. You should submit the entire content of the repository as a zip file. The repository on GitHub must be accessible by me (username stevenaeola). Allow access to the repository through Settings - Manage Access - Invite a collaborator. If you do not allow access you will lose marks. Note that this does not affect the access to any code you may write, which would most likely be in a public repository.</p>
